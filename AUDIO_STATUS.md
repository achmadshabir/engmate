# Audio Features Status

## ✅ WORKING (with Mock AI)

### Microphone Recording
- ✅ Browser captures audio (webm format)
- ✅ Audio chunks detected (1128-1948 bytes per chunk)
- ✅ Audio blob created (35-75 KB)
- ✅ Audio sent to backend successfully
- ✅ Backend receives and processes audio
- ✅ Mock ASR returns transcription
- ✅ Response displayed in UI chat

**Test Result**: Recording works perfectly with mock AI!

### Text Input
- ✅ Text input works
- ✅ Mock LLM generates response
- ✅ Response displayed in UI

## ❌ NOT WORKING

### TTS (Text-to-Speech)
**Issue**: No audio playback from AI responses

**Root Cause**: Mock TTS provider doesn't generate playable audio files

**Mock TTS Code** (`backend/app/providers/mock.py`):
```python
async def synthesize_speech(self, text: str, language: str = "en") -> str:
    # Returns mock URL but no actual audio file
    return "/storage/audio/mock_tts_audio.wav"
```

**What's Missing**:
1. No actual audio file generated
2. No audio player in frontend to play TTS
3. Backend doesn't serve audio files from `/storage/audio/`

### ASR with Real Whisper
**Issue**: HF Space API integration not working

**Root Cause**: Gradio API format mismatch

**Current Status**: Using mock ASR (returns fake transcription)

### TTS with Real Model
**Issue**: HF Space TTS not integrated

**Current Status**: Using mock TTS (no audio output)

## 🎯 Next Steps to Fix

### Priority 1: Enable Real ASR (Whisper)
1. Fix Gradio API call in `huggingface_asr.py`
2. Test with HF Space: https://abeachmad-engmate-asr.hf.space
3. Set `USE_MOCK_AI=false` in backend/.env

### Priority 2: Enable Real TTS
1. Fix Gradio API call in `huggingface_tts.py`
2. Test with HF Space: https://abeachmad-engmate-tts.hf.space
3. Ensure audio files are saved and served correctly

### Priority 3: Add Audio Player in Frontend
1. Add `<audio>` element to ChatMessage component
2. Auto-play TTS audio when assistant message arrives
3. Add speaker button to replay audio

## 🔧 Quick Fix for TTS (Mock Mode)

To make TTS work in mock mode, we need to:

1. **Generate actual audio file** in mock TTS provider
2. **Serve audio files** via FastAPI static files
3. **Add audio player** in frontend ChatMessage component

## 📊 Current Architecture

```
User speaks → Browser records (✅)
           → Send to backend (✅)
           → Mock ASR transcribes (✅ fake)
           → Mock LLM generates text (✅)
           → Mock TTS "generates" audio (❌ no file)
           → Response sent to frontend (✅)
           → Text displayed (✅)
           → Audio NOT played (❌)
```

## 🎯 Target Architecture

```
User speaks → Browser records (✅)
           → Send to backend (✅)
           → Real ASR transcribes (⏳ needs fix)
           → Real LLM generates text (✅ Groq works)
           → Real TTS generates audio (⏳ needs fix)
           → Audio file saved (⏳ needs fix)
           → Response with audio URL (⏳ needs fix)
           → Text displayed (✅)
           → Audio auto-played (⏳ needs implementation)
```

## 🚀 Recommendation

**For MVP/Demo**: Keep mock AI enabled, focus on fixing real ASR/TTS integration

**For Production**: 
1. Fix HF Space Gradio API calls
2. Test end-to-end with real models
3. Deploy to Vercel with working audio
4. Monitor HF Space uptime and performance

## 📝 Notes

- Mock AI is useful for development and testing UI
- Real AI integration requires fixing Gradio API format
- TTS audio playback needs frontend implementation
- All infrastructure is ready, just needs API fixes
