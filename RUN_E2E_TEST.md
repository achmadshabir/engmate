# How to Run E2E Tests

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start backend and frontend
./dev-start.sh

# 2. Wait for services to start (about 5 seconds)
# Press Ctrl+C to exit log view (services keep running)

# 3. Run automated tests (in new terminal)
./test-e2e.sh

# 4. Stop services when done
./dev-stop.sh
```

## What Gets Tested

The automated script tests:
- ✅ Health endpoints
- ✅ User profile
- ✅ Session start & conversation
- ✅ Auth signup
- ✅ Vocabulary CRUD
- ✅ SRS review system
- ✅ Pronunciation analysis
- ✅ Lessons

## Expected Output

## If Tests Fail

1. Check logs:
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/backend.log
   ```

2. Check if services are running:
   ```bash
   lsof -i:8000  # Backend
   lsof -i:3000  # Frontend
   ```

3. Restart services:
   ```bash
   ./dev-stop.sh
   ./dev-start.sh
   ```
